## Overview

This is a classification problem where we need to predict whether a person earns more than a sum of 50,000 USD anuually or not. This classification task is accomplished by using a CatBoost Classifier trained on the dataset extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. The dataset contains about 33k records and 15 features which after all the implementation of all standard techniques like Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Outlier Treatment, etc was feeded to our Classifier which after training and testing, was deployed in the form of a web application.

## Project Goal

This end-to-end project is made as a part of data science internship for [Ineuron.ai](https://ineuron.ai/).

## Technical Aspects

The whole project has been divided into three parts. These are listed as follows :

• Data Preparation : This consists of storing our data into cassandra database and utilizing it, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, EDA, etc.

• Model Development : In this step, we use the resultant data after the implementation of the previous step to cross validate our Machine Learning model and perform Hyperparameter optimization based on various performance metrics in order to make our model predict as accurate results as possible.

• Model Deployment : This step include creation of a front-end using Anvil, Flask and Heroku to put our trained model into production.

## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.9. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run on your Local Machine

To run the flask server on your local machine, just run the following code in your command prompt in the project directory :
```bash
python server.py
```
This will start the run the [server.py](https://github.com/saxenashefali/Adult-Census-Income-Prediction/blob/master/server.py) which will also trigger code for [server_app.py](https://github.com/saxenashefali/Adult-Census-Income-Prediction/blob/master/server_app.py) because of the use of asynchronous execution (threading) and will connect our ML model to Anvil application UI and will keep the server running till the web page rendered by flask application gets closed but to keep the server running forever, we used the heroku cloud to run our server continuously.

## Bug / Feature Request
If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/rauhanahmed/ineuron_internship/new) by including your search query and the expected result.

If you'd like to request a new function, feel free to do so by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/rauhanahmed/ineuron_internship/issues/new). Please include sample queries and their corresponding results.
